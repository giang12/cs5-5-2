## Problems:

Ehanced 8 by 16bit register files with internal bypassing function. 

[Design Schedmatic](schematic-01.pdf) 

### Problem 2 (Synthesis FIFO from HW3)

Description:

Copy all files necessary to compile your FIFO from homework 3 to the hw4_2 directory. Synthesize your FIFO.  

Synthesis will create the synth directory which will include fifo.syn.v, area report, timing report, etc. Do not delete this directory - it must be included in your submission. Make sure that in the area report no cell has an area of zero  


### Problem 3 (64bit FIFO)

Develop instruction level tests for your processor.
1. sub  
2. jal  
3. jalr
