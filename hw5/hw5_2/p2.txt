// Write your answer to Problem 2 (b) and (c) here

a) Write an assembly program to demonstrate why branch prediction is necessary and useful. Write your code in p2.asm.


b) Write an explanation of your program and how branch prediction helps in p2.txt.
  if there is no branch prediction, the beq instuction will cause a control harzard 
  (you will not be able to fetch any new instruction until the evalution of the condition is done)
  
  in p2, by asssue the branch will not taken, the processor are able to fetch new instruction in each
  clock cycle, and if the prediction is indeed correct, then, you avoid potential stall

c) Will branch prediction always take only 1 cycle? Write your answer in p2.txt.
  No, it dependents on at which stage you dectect the branch misprediction,
  if it is in execution stage, then you might need to flush two instructions, in that case, it will
  takes two cycle
